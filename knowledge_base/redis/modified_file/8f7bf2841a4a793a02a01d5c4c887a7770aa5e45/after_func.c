 * epoch.
 *
 * BACKGROUND
 *
 * It is not possible that different slaves get the same config
 * epoch during a failover election, because the slaves need to get voted
 * by a majority. However when we perform a manual resharding of the cluster
 * the node will assign a configuration epoch to itself without to ask
 * for agreement. Usually resharding happens when the cluster is working well
 * and is supervised by the sysadmin, however it is possible for a failover
 * to happen exactly while the node we are resharding a slot to assigns itself
 * a new configuration epoch, but before it is able to propagate it.
 *
 * So technically it is possible in this condition that two nodes end with
 * the same configuration epoch.
 *
 * Another possibility is that there are bugs in the implementation causing
 * this to happen.
 *
 * Moreover when a new cluster is created, all the nodes start with the same
 * configEpoch. This collision resolution code allows nodes to automatically
 * end with a different configEpoch at startup automatically.
 *
 * In all the cases, we want a mechanism that resolves this issue automatically
 * as a safeguard. The same configuration epoch for masters serving different
 * set of slots is not harmful, but it is if the nodes end serving the same
 * slots for some reason (manual errors or software bugs) without a proper
 * failover procedure.
 *
 * In general we want a system that eventually always ends with different
 * masters having different configuration epochs whatever happened, since
 * nothign is worse than a split-brain condition in a distributed system.
 *
 * BEHAVIOR
 *
 * When this function gets called, what happens is that if this node
 * has the lexicographically smaller Node ID compared to the other node
 * with the conflicting epoch (the 'sender' node), it will assign itself
 * the greatest configuration epoch currently detected among nodes plus 1.
 *
 * This means that even if there are multiple nodes colliding, the node
 * with the greatest Node ID never moves forward, so eventually all the nodes
 * end with a different configuration epoch.

 * CLUSTER nodes blacklist
 *
 * The nodes blacklist is just a way to ensure that a given node with a given
 * Node ID is not readded before some time elapsed (this time is specified
 * in seconds in CLUSTER_BLACKLIST_TTL).
 *
 * This is useful when we want to remove a node from the cluster completely:
 * when CLUSTER FORGET is called, it also puts the node into the blacklist so
 * that even if we receive gossip messages from other nodes that still remember
 * about the node we want to remove, we don't re-add it before some time.
 *
 * Currently the CLUSTER_BLACKLIST_TTL is set to 1 minute, this means
 * that redis-trib has 60 seconds to send CLUSTER FORGET messages to nodes
 * in the cluster without dealing with the problem of other nodes re-adding
 * back the node to nodes we already sent the FORGET command to.
