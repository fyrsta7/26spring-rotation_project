 * Note: it is possible to use a negative increment in order to
 * right-trim the string.
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 * Using sdsIncrLen() and sdsMakeRoomFor() it is possible to mount the
 * following schema, to cat bytes coming from the kernel to the end of an
 * sds string without copying into an intermediate buffer:
 *
 * oldlen = sdslen(s);
 * s = sdsMakeRoomFor(s, BUFFER_SIZE);
 * nread = read(fd, s+oldlen, BUFFER_SIZE);
 * ... check for nread <= 0 and handle it ...
 * sdsIncrLen(s, nread);
