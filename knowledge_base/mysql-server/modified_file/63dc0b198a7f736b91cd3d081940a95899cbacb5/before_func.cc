/*
  If not selecting by given key, create an index how records should be read

  SYNOPSIS
   create_sort_index()
     thd		Thread handler
     join		Join with table to sort
     order		How table should be sorted
     filesort_limit	Max number of rows that needs to be sorted
     select_limit	Max number of rows in final output
		        Used to decide if we should use index or not
  IMPLEMENTATION
   - If there is an index that can be used, the first non-const join_tab in
     'join' is modified to use this index.
   - If no index, create with filesort() an index file that can be used to
     retrieve rows in order (should be done with 'read_record').
     The sorted data is stored in tab->table and will be freed when calling
     free_io_cache(tab->table).

  RETURN VALUES
    0		ok
    -1		Some fatal error
    1		No records
