        "message": "transaction: make transaction collapsing smarter with > 2 views\n\nSway maintains a list of pending transactions, and tries to merge\nconsecutive transactions applying to the same views into one. Given\na pending transactions list on views {A, B, C} of:\n\n  A -> A' -> A'' -> B -> B' -> B''\n\nSway will collapse the transactions into just A'' -> B''. This works\nfine when doing things like resizing views by their border. However,\nwhen interactively resizing layouts like H[V[A B] C], we end up with\npending transaction lists like:\n\n  A -> B -> C -> A' -> B' -> C' -> A'' -> B'' -> C''\n\nPreviously, Sway would not be able to simplify this transaction list,\nand execute many more transactions than would be necessary (the final\nstate is determined by {A'', B'', C''}).\n\nAfter this commit, the transaction list gets simplified to A'' -> B'' ->\nC'', resolving performance problems (that were particularly noticeable\nwith high-refresh-rate mice).\n\nFixes #5736.",
