*  `dstCapacity` must be >= sizeof(bitD->bitContainer), otherwise @return will be an error code.
*
*  bits are first added to a local register.
*  Local register is size_t, hence 64-bits on 64-bits systems, or 32-bits on 32-bits systems.
*  Writing data into memory is an explicit operation, performed by the flushBits function.
*  Hence keep track how many bits are potentially stored into local register to avoid register overflow.
*  After a flushBits, a maximum of 7 bits might still be stored into local register.
*
*  Avoid storing elements of more than 24 bits if you want compatibility with 32-bits bitstream readers.
*
*  Last operation is to close the bitStream.
*  The function returns the final size of CStream in bytes.
*  If data couldn't fit into `dstBuffer`, it will return a 0 ( == not storable)
