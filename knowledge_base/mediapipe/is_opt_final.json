        "message": "Default to high-performance power preference hint for WebGL contexts. For some computers with dual GPUs (like MBP2019), this will more frequently give us the higher performance GPU, which is generally preferable for most of our use cases (realtime rendering and ML), since speed is more critical than power consumption. If necessary, the user can override this setting by requesting their canvas' WebGL context manually before initializing the graph.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 637965687",
